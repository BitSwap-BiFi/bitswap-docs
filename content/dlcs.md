# Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs)

Bitswap seamlessly integrates Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) to bring the power of smart contracts and conditional agreements to the decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. DLCs enable complex financial transactions without compromising user privacy or security. In this section, we'll explore how Bitswap leverages DLCs, the role of DLCs within RGB20 assets, their mission in the DEX, and a comparison with Chainlink.

## What Are DLCs?

Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) are a cryptographic innovation that allows users to create smart contracts based on outcomes of real-world events without revealing the specifics of those events. These contracts are trustless and secure, making them ideal for a wide range of applications, including derivatives, hedging, and more.

## RGB20 Assets and DLCs

### Issuing and Transferring RGB20 Assets

Bitswap utilizes the RGB protocol for the tokenization of assets, including the creation of RGB20 assets. These assets can represent anything from NFTs to tokenized securities. DLCs play a vital role in enabling secure and trustless transfers of RGB20 assets directly on the Bitcoin network.

### Secure and Private Transfers

DLCs ensure that transfers of RGB20 assets are executed with privacy and security as top priorities. The contract terms are predefined, and the execution occurs without revealing sensitive information about the parties involved.

## DLCs' Mission on DEX

### Enabling Complex Financial Transactions

Within Bitswap's DEX, DLCs empower users to engage in complex financial transactions such as swaps, derivatives, and conditional agreements. This mission extends to providing users with versatile trading options while maintaining privacy and security.

### Decentralized and Non-Custodial Trading

DLCs in the DEX context ensure that users maintain control of their private keys and assets throughout the trading process. This approach enhances security and eliminates the risks associated with centralized exchanges.

## DLCs vs. Chainlink

DLCs offer a distinct advantage over traditional oracles like Chainlink:

- **Trustlessness:** DLCs do not rely on trusted third parties, making them more secure and decentralized.

- **Privacy:** DLCs are designed to maintain user privacy by not exposing sensitive data during the contract execution, while Chainlink may involve external data providers.

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** DLCs can be more cost-effective, as they do not require fees for data retrieval from external sources.
